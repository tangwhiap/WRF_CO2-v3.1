The OBS2GRID system can extract the data from SENSE and convert it to binary grid data, 
used to compare the observation with WRF output data

The grid structure (xdef ydef zdef tdef info) have the time and spatial dimensions which are as same as it defined in WRF output.
So users can open both observation grid data and WRF output data in GrADS without conflict.

This brief document can tell you how to run this program.

===========================

Usage:
# 1. Link the SENSE data directory to $PDir/data/SENSE
# 2. Link the wrfout ctl directory to $PDir/data/WRF
# 3. Write or check the stations_info.txt $PDir/data/station_info (for more information, see next part)
# 4. If the fortran source code have been modified, or you want to return the whole system to initial state, it's better to do "./all-init.sh" in $PDir/src
# 5. Run the top-level shell script use "./obs2grid.sh" in $PDir/src
# 6. The output files with the name formatted as "obs_dom.gdat" or "obs_dom_YYYY-MM-DD_hh:mm:ss" and a CTL file "obs_dom.ctl" can be found in $PDir/output
# 7. The hourly, daily, monthly averaged data in $PDir/output have the name formatted as "obs_dom_hourly.gdat", "obs_dom_daily.gdat", "obs_dom_monthly.gdat" respectly, with the CTL file "obs_dom_hourly.ctl", "obs_dom_daily.ctl", "obs_dom_monthly.ctl" respectly

($PDir here refers the root directory of the OBS2GRID system, i.e. the directory of this document you are reading now)

===========================

stations_info.txt :
A text file to define which station in SENSE data can be added in observation grid data.
format: 
StationName(in directory) StationName longitude(degrees) latitude(degrees) height(m)
for example: 
pr003CMAH1 XiangHe_h1 116.9578 39.7833 10

use "#" at the begining of the line can invalidate it.
